				<p>
					I am a fresh graduate from Alexandria University studying Electronics
					and Communication Engineering. I am passionate about Software
					Development. I'm currently working on improving my skillset by
					studying MEARN full-stack development in ITI to land my dream job and
					pursue my career as a Web Developer.
					<br />
					<br />
					I am also interested in Machine Learning and Computer Vision, and I
					worked in a couple of project using Computer Vision. I am also
					familiar with Embedded Systems, especially AVR microcontrollers, and
					interfacing with multiple peripherals. Aside from that, I also work as
					a Robotics Instructor and coached multiple teams through different
					Robotics Competitions.
					<br />
					<br />
					I am fluent in both English and Arabic, and one day I want to learn
					Spanish and Italian too. My non-professional passions include
					swimming, reading and being a constant learner. My bucket list also
					incudes learning to play the guitar and dance bachata.
					<br />
					<br />
					While I am working towards these goals, I am using every opportunity
					that I get to gain new skills and refine my existing ones. I do that
					because I believe that a diverse skill set is essential to becoming an
					effective leader in all aspects of life.
					<br />
					<br />I am always looking to meet with new people and get to know them
					better. If you would like to grab a cup of coffee, please shoot me an
					email!
